  title: "Project 32 Bit Rackets (Game Boy Emulation)",
  content: {
    "Built": "November - December 2018",
    "Language(s)": "C",
    "About": `Behold, the world's most advanced handheld tennis simulator... well, if realism and physics weren't taken into account. You're up against a CPU capable of picking off the likes of Serena Williams in just a few swings with 3 sets to prove your skill. Get your serves and swing timing down, and you just might become the next world champ.`,
    "Challenges": `Creating macros for ball gravity and velocity that felt good to play, given limitations on refresh rate, was certainly difficult. There's also no way to truly "debug" or "test" on a Game Boy, so there was a fair amount of guess and check. Still, it was a rewarding process and great way to learn an already challenging language.`,

  title: "Project FingerGun",
  content: {
    "Built": "October 23-25, 2018 @ HackGT",
    "Language(s)": "JavaScript + ThreeJS, HTML, CSS",
    "About": `In this simulation, the fate of the world rests in your hands... your fingers to be precise. FingerGun uses advanced motion tracking (*ahem* color detection) from your computer's webcam to put you right in the action. Shoot down asteroids approaching your space cruiser to stay alive, but be careful! You're in for a rocky ride.`,
    "Challenges": `Beyond the natural challenge of building a motion tracking, browser-based game in 48 hours, picking up ThreeJS for the first time required some serious experimentation. I myself focused on reaching a retro-aesthetic for introducing rulesets to match our wireframe graphics. Always up for some outlandish CSS :)`

  title: "Project Galaga - Level 1",
  content: {
    "Built": "May 2015",
    "Language(s)": "Java + Swing",
    "About": `Well, it's Galaga ü§∑‚Äç`,
    "Challenges": `This game is still special to me since it's the first full game I ever made. Armed with a few months of Java Swing experience, an ancient IDE called BlueJ, and the GIMP photo editor, I set out to make an arcade classic (with some updated sprite shading to boot). It took weeks to hit completion, and it still only plays through the first level, but it was the first exciting project I had to get me into programming.`,
